# PCA Analysis of Arbitrage Opportunities

## Overview
This notebook performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on arbitrage opportunities derived from blockchain transaction data. The goal is to identify patterns, reduce dimensionality, and analyze the relationships between opportunity profit and transaction gas fees. The analysis provides insights into the underlying factors influencing arbitrage opportunities.

## Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and modify compressed array data.
   - Replace metadata with integer indices for easier processing.
   - Save the modified data and metadata for further analysis.

2. **PCA Implementation**:
   - Perform PCA to extract principal components.
   - Analyze the explained variance ratio to determine the significance of each component.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Plot cumulative explained variance with a logarithmic x-axis.
   - Visualize the first principal component and its logarithmic transformation.
   - Perform FFT analysis on the first principal component to identify periodic patterns.

4. **Opportunity Profit Analysis**:
   - Filter and sort transaction data based on opportunity profit and gas fees.
   - Visualize relationships between opportunity profit and transaction priority fees.
   - Analyze total opportunity profit for different gas fee levels.

## Prerequisites
